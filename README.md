Dietary tool for Reading, UK eateries (Last updated: Oct 2017)

ReadiBites is a detailed, Android app directory of Reading, UK eateries, and contains information on each regarding their: allergens, calories and vegan/vegetarian/gluten free menu options. You can search by location name, filter by location type/area, sort by dietary requirement compatibility and many other embedded features! Its available on the Google Play Store and is completely free (no ads/micro-transactions/purchase price).

Whilst at my previous job, I was speaking to a coworker and the topic of their dietary requirements came up. They found it inconvenient when going out in Reading, as they often had to check a few places' website/menu to find out if they supported their dietary requirements.

After graduating, I used the knowledge gained from the software degree, coupled with time spent learning the Android development environment, to create a solution. I spent a month working on planning the location search area, gathering location data and coding the app. Over 130 Reading eateries, ranging from gastropubs, restaurants, cafes and various other types are included in the app, with more being added/updated periodically.
